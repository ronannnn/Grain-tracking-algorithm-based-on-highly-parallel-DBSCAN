# USC CSCI 596 Final Project -- Grain tracking based on highly parallel DBSCAN
This is a readme file of a parallel molecular dynamics (MD) program. The sintering processes of aluminum nitride nanopowders is simulated with parallel MD. The output data is further analyzed using a highly parallel Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HPDBSCAN) technique. Grains could be recognized and tracked simultaneously during  the sintering process in this program.
## 0. Prerequisites
Only needed are C compiler and MPI.
## 1. How to compile and run
If the C compiler on your computer is cc (also common is gcc for GNU C compiler), type:
...
This will create an executable ...
